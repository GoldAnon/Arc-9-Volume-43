――Petra Leyte is a country girl from Arlam Village, a village within the Kingdom of Lugunica.

Born with an extraordinary appearance and natural skill, yet possessing nothing else particularly noteworthy, she probably would have lived out her life as a mere villager, likely dreaming of moving to the city without ever having the chance to be involved in events worthy of being etched into history.

Therefore, Petra's current existence, having strayed from its “original” route and become entangled in numerous significant incidents etched into history, is one that has been skewed by interference.

Petra herself was aware that her fate had been skewed.

The “original” Petra was a spoiled girl who took pride in her cuteness and mistakenly believed she could manipulate everyone around her, adults and children alike. Surely, the “original” Petra would have spent her life selfishly playing the ruler of her small world, never having that misconception corrected.

It was not necessarily a bad life. That path would have been enjoyable and happy in its own way.

However, the current Petra's values, which have strayed from the “original”, simply could not find happiness in that.

Petra: [Because none of the people I love now would be there, right?]

There would be no Subaru, no Frederica, no Emilia, no Beatrice, no Meili, no Ram, no Rem, no Ryuzu, no Annerose, no Garfiel, no Otto, no Clind. Roswaal… well, he could be done without. ――But everyone would be gone.

Petra: [It gives me the creeps.]

If the “original” version of her was someone who never met the people she loved, and if the person she is now is the result of some collision of fate, then she was truly glad it happened.

As a result of taking a different route than the “original” one, she encountered one painful experience after another: painful suffering, terrible agony, heartbreaking sorrow, tiresome hardship, near-death experiences, and situations where death seemed preferable.

But, more than all the hardships she had endured, there were things she was bestowed with, things she was able to gain.

That was what Petra Leyte wholeheartedly believed.

Petra: [Even if I could redo my life over and over again, would I still stray from my "original" path?]

After all, I want to meet you again and again, and tell you this.

Because that person who has known the same suffering as you, gazed out to the stars with such evident pain and anguish.

Petra Leyte is――,

△▼△▼△▼△

――God, Buddha, Od Lagna. For as long as I live, I hereby vow never to see someone off on a journey.

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [――Hk!]

They exhaled forcefully, kicked off the hard rocky ground, and ran with reckless abandon.

Correcting their form, leaning forward, they took off with a start so perfect they could not help but admire themselves, and they ran, ran, ran, faster than they ever had in their entire life.

With the thumping sound of blood rushing through their body growing unbearably loud, their chest pounded from within as their heart beat like it was about to explode, they ran, leaving their own ragged breath behind.

Even after desperately running so hard――,

???: [――Play ball.]

The instant that cold declaration reached her back, their view changed completely.

By the time they realized it, the legs that had been running faster than ever in their life had stopped, leaving them standing dazed on the rocky ground. Before them lay the familiar scene they thought they had left behind, and within it, the man in the iron helmet murmured.

???: [――Expand Territory, Matrix Redefinition.]

That was the cue that the man, his face hidden behind a jet-black helmet, had begun some scheme by employing his Authority.

That moment began with his declaration, and within their field of vision, their unsuspecting comrades let out a roar that shook the very air.

???: [Let’s get him, you bastards!!]
???: [――YEAHHH!!]

Centered on the courageous girl's battle cry, the group's morale reached its climax and exploded. Riding that momentum, they all lunged at the man in the iron helmet at once. ――But to no avail.

The outcome was already clear. No matter how desperately they reached out, their hands would never touch their opponent.

"----"
???: [――――]

Like marionettes whose strings had been severed, thirty-seven people collapsed one by one onto the ground as they stood.

They all appeared to fall simultaneously. Yet, having closely observed each individual's fall, they already knew there was a subtle sequence to how they fell. Still, the time between the first person falling and the thirty-seventh and final person falling was barely two seconds.

There was no room to intervene in those mere seconds, and any attempt to do so proved futile.

???: [It's not futile. figuring out that this method won't work isn't futile.]

And then, to eardrums that held such a thirsty sentiment, a voice ――no, not from their eardrums. This voice was not the kind that actually vibrated the air to reach them, so it was not their eardrums that were vibrated.

If their eardrums weren't vibrating, then what in the world was?

???: [It's obvious, isn't it? It's your heart.]

The heart. ――Yes, that is right. That is what it was. Because their heart trembled, they could hear it.

There was still plenty of room left for a trembling heart. As if to prove it, he was there.

And his name was――,

???: [――Subaru.]

“Subaru”: [Yeah, I’m right here, Petra.]

His lips called out to Petra, and she felt relieved.

That's right. I'm Petra Leyte, and I still haven't given that up.

If that is the case, then, therefore, if so, then, therefore, because that is how it was.

???: [――Play ball.]

――Yet still, Petra Leyte must continue this journey through hell.

△▼△▼△▼△

――God, Buddha, Od Lagna. For as long as I live, I vow to never accept anyone's charity.

△▼△▼△▼△

Al: [――Expand Territory, Matrix Redefinition.]
Al: [――Play ball.]

A respite that began with that proclamation and ended with it.

Trapped within a loop lasting less than a minute, how much time had passed for Petra?

Petra: […but not even a second had passed.]

Petra let out a raspy breath as she answered the whisper in her own heart.

She even thought it was a terribly cynical, self-mocking, world-weary mutter, and she was startled to realize she could produce such a dark, murky emotional sound.

But, it certainly was not a mistake or a mishearing of someone else's voice.

Because here――,

Petra: [It's just my, those people, that man, and Subaru's voices.]

Petra plopped down on her bottom right there, pulled her knees up to her chest, pressed her forehead against them, and muttered.

Before her eyes, the scene unfolded once more, a group of thirty-seven people was about to pounce on the lone helmeted man, only to be silently dispatched in an instant.

Really, what is wrong here? Why can they not understand?

Petra: [Aren't all of you being stupid? Why do you just charge straight in without any strategy, even though they know they're going to get beaten…]

Look, they have been beaten again. One after another, they all fall down.

It had been a familiar sight, a comical spectacle more ridiculous than the villains whom the heroes endlessly beat as part of “Hero Time” on TV.

Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again――.

Petra: [――How ridiculous.]

Even though there should be smart people among them, why, just how come, was there no ingenuity? They had been done in time and time again, so why not try a different approach?

Yes. They are unaware they have been beaten time and again. They don't know they have been defeated numerous times, nor do they realize they will be defeated many more times in the future.

Since they did not know what lay ahead, it was only inevitable that they would be swept up in the predictable outcome. This is just venting frustration, blaming them. It is unreasonable. 
It was absurd. She knew. She knew, but still.

Petra: [Even so, you're all adults, so do something about it…!]

Again, over and over again, she smashed her forehead against her folded knees.

It hurts. It doesn't hurt. It hurts. It doesn't hurt. It hurts. It doesn't hurt. It hurts. It doesn't hurt. It hurts. It hurts.

Petra: [AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"――Playball."HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.]

                ×  ×  ×

Petra: [AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"――Expand Territory, Matrix Redefinition."HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.]

She managed to raise her voice at both the end and the beginning of the loop. But what did that matter?

When Petra suddenly began shouting strange cries, her behavior caused a change in everyone's actions as they were about to lunge at the man in the iron helmet. They looked over at her, and the sight of Petra clawing at her head and screaming made their faces turn pale.

???: [Oi, What’s wrong!?]
???: [Petra! What's wrong? What happened!?]
???: [Get back, Petra! You're the cornerstone for Ram and the others!]

Voices reached out. Cried out in alarm, everyone tried to comfort the shrieking Petra with their fresh, urgent words, worried about her after being struck by the strange occurrence.

I'm so happy. Thank you. I love you all. Really. Truly. But there is no way.

Petra: […I know all this, don’t I?]

Petra knew precisely what kind of words everyone would give to her if she lost her composure like this.

Petra knew that when she tried her hardest to explain the loop, everyone would rack their brains over it.

Petra knew that if she suggested everyone scatter and flee via Compression, they would listen.

I know. I know everything. I saw it, heard it, spoke it, taught it, conveyed it, consulted it, thought about it, agonized over it, challenged it, devised it, tried it, gave up, picked it up again, and discarded it once more.

Petra: [Say something different. Show me something different. Be different. Do something different from before, from last time, from next time, from this time…!]

Petra's face contorted into an ugly mess, her voice cracked ungracefully, her nails scraped the ground until they nearly peeled off, and she let out incomprehensible cries. Everyone fell silent, immediately pinpointing the cause, and turned their fury toward the man in the iron helmet, baring their teeth.

???: [Petra, stand up. Ram will lend you a shoulder.]

As the group pounced on the man in the iron helmet, one person broke away and offered Petra a hand.

Kind. Even in this situation, even with stern words and expression, their touch is gentle. How lovely.

Petra: [But,]

Al: [――Play ball.]

                ×  ×  ×

Al: [――Expand Territory, Matrix Redefinition.]

Yes, her disheveled face, chipped nails, and raspy voice were all back to normal.

All the concern they showed, the righteous indignation that arose, the worry for their younger sister, all reset. ――Reset, with a clean slate, let us savor this beginning and end once more.

???: [Let’s get him, you bastards!!]
???: [――YEAHHH!!]

Everyone is so lucky. With that fresh feeling, they can shout out again,

I can't do it. I just can't. I tried to fight alongside them, and we fought together more than a hundred times. But nothing changed, and everyone collapsed before me, their eyes rolling back in their heads. It's just so unfair, isn't it?

Petra: [Maybe I'll cheat too.]

Pouting her lips, she let those words slip.

Before long, everyone had gone beddy-bye, and in front of Petra, a man approached, jingling the metal fittings of his helmet as his messy footsteps echoed.

Petra: [――――]

The man slowly extended his hand, which had been fiddling with the metal fitting, toward Petra.

She wondered if that helmet was properly maintained. It would need oiling, polishing, and upkeep, right? It felt like someone who had been fighting nonstop without even bathing, a hand reaching out like that made her feel a bit repulsed. But she endured, and endured, and continued to endure waiting for that extended hand to reach. Staring might make it awkward. So, I will close my eyes, so catch me while you can. Ready, one, two, three…

                ×  ×  ×

Al: [――Expand Territory, Matrix Redefinition.]

Yeah, I knew it. Getting caught doesn't work. Ahahaha, die already.

△▼△▼△▼△

――God, Buddha, Od Lagna. For as long as I live, I vow never to recount my failures.

△▼△▼△▼△

Al: [――Expand Territory, Matrix Redefinition.]

As if on cue, the loop began. Even when Petra first realized she had been seized by it, she maintained her composure without becoming overly distraught, despite the abnormal situation.

Of course, she was somewhat unsettled, but it was far less than expected.

That was because――,

"Subaru": [Petra! We're looping in short bursts! It's Al's next move!]

The one who shouted on Petra's behalf was the Imaginary Subaru, the only one who shared the loop Petra had been drawn into and understood the repeating flow of time.

The existence of “Subaru” and the message glimpsed just before being pulled into the loop from Old Man Rom, ――marks carved into the ground, counting something, had suppressed Petra’s unease.

Petra: [Rom-ojiisan had gone through the same ordeal I'm facing now.]

A single horizontal line with four vertical lines overlaid is a counting method called the “tally method,” commonly represented by the kanji character “正”

By leaving those marks on the ground, Old Man Rom conveyed his situation to Petra.

It would be hard to believe that Old Man Rom reached that state after just five repetitions. What he meant to convey was not the number of times he repeated it, but the act of repeating itself, which seems like information that came too late for Petra, who found herself in the same situation. ――But that was not the case.

The message left behind by Old Man Rom served as a clear warning to Petra.

In other words, what Old Man Rom really wanted to express was this.

Petra: [If I keep repeating things like this, I'll end up like Rom-ojiisan.]

Old Man Rom had no external injuries when he collapsed, so it was as if he had been ravaged by wounds accumulated over repeated cycles of time. ――No, in a sense, it was undeniably the result of accumulation.

In other words, Old Man Rom's spirit was completely worn down within the cycle of repeating time.

Indeed, this was the very tactic Petra and the Aldebusters had employed against Al, and it could be said the situation had come full circle, as if they were getting a taste of their own medicine.

She did not believe Al was specifically aiming for that kind of retaliation. Still, regardless, had Petra been swept up in the situation without any preparation, she too might have met the same fate as Old Man Rom.

"Subaru": [No, it's not just Old Man Rom. From the looks of it, Ram and the others are in the same boat.]

Petra: […Yeah. Al-san used his Authority on everyone charging at him the same way …But at the time when the loop starts, everyone is conscious, right?]

"Subaru": [Is it possible… even though we’re repeating the same situation, events outside the loop could still be happening in real time? Like, people who get beaten could be leaving? If that’s the case.]

Petra: [――I’m the only one left now.]

The conversation with “Subaru” was so utterly despairing that Petra could not help but stiffen her cheeks.

If, hypothetically, by the time this loop came around to Petra, the fate of the Aldebusters' collapse could not be changed,

Petra: [Even after the loop ends…]

"Subaru": [Wait, wait, wait, wait, don’t get pessimistic. Even if… even if, that were the case, we have the Authority of Tristitia, right? So, we could Compress the cooldown or something.]

Petra: […Compress the time they are unconscious and wake them up on the spot?]

"Subaru": [That's right! We've never tried it, but wouldn't it be awesome if we could pull it off?]

Petra's breath caught slightly at Subaru's idea as he snapped his fingers.

While it is possible to utilize the Authority to “compress” the time required for discussions or learning new techniques, it required a corresponding amount of energy.

Simply put, if Petra Compressed a single day, it would consume a day's worth of energy. Three days would require three days' worth, seven days would require seven days' worth, and so on. If healing a worn-out heart takes a month or even years, there was no way to cover the energy needed.

Compression is by no means all-powerful. ――But even so,

Petra: [――Yeah, I think that would be really awesome. I might be able to do it.]

"Subaru": [Right? That's why you gotta commit this to memory. The moment we break out of the loop, the first thing we do is get everyone back on their feet. If we don't, we'll get knocked down all at once.]

She nodded back at "Subaru", who was already optimistic about what would happen after the loop ended.

Looking back now, Old Man Rom probably thought the same thing. Or perhaps that wise elder, even with his heart worn thin, unconsciously prioritized carving a message into the ground, repeating the loop over and over to make sure his actions stuck after it ended.

If that was the case, then “Subaru’s” proposal to decide what actions to take immediately after exiting the loop should be adopted.

However――,

Petra: […Just how many times did Rom-ojiisan have to redo it until his body remembered?]

Even when his heart was worn to shreds and he could no longer hold on to his sense of self, Old Man Rom still managed to claw at the ground with his finger immediately after the loop ended. How many times must he have repeated that action, ingraining it into his soul, until it became something he could do even with his mind shattered?

Petra: [――――]

"Subaru": [Petra, let's go over it. beako once tricked me into an endless loop down the same hallway. If the rules of that are the same, there must be a condition to break the loop.]

Petra swallowed hard after "Subaru" outlined the next course of action. Petra nodded with a smile and a “Yeah,” and looked ahead once more.

???: [Let’s get him, you bastards!!]
???: [――YEAHHH!!]

Even amidst Petra and “Subaru's” current conversation, the scene repeated itself incessantly with the Aldebusters charging at Al, only to fall in a heap before him.

Honestly, the way Subaru approached each loop as seen in his “Book of the Dead”, carefully taking each one to heart and building up the experience within himself, it was something Petra respected and thought was very cool. But trying to do the same thing in a loop that lasted under a minute seemed difficult.

"Subaru": [I understand it's unreasonable to make us suffer every time we watch everyone getting taken down. But still, we need to remember this properly.]

Petra: [How many times have we repeated this?]

"Subaru": [Yeah, the number of times is one thing, but more importantly, it’s about your feelings, how you got angry, frustrated, or sad each time.]

Petra: [――Yeah, you're right.]

In this world of repetition, this endless loop that continued time and time again, Petra alone would carry on these feelings. So, as Subaru said, she would remember them properly.

Even if Al was unaware of what Petra and the others went through after escaping the loop, she would not forgive him. She would absolutely make him pay for how much they suffered.

With that vow in her heart, Petra nodded to “Subaru“ and they looked ahead.

Al: [――It’s the stars. Your stars were bad.]

With that, they locked eyes with Al directly in front of them――,

Al: [――Play ball.]
"Subaru": [――Play ball.]

Yes, he heroically pronounced a declaration to set out on a journey through hell.

△▼△▼△▼△

――God, Buddha, Od Lagna. For as long as I live, I vow to never let anyone else braid my hair.

△▼△▼△▼△

――And so Petra, having steeled her resolve and continued to wander through the hell she had plunged into.

Petra: […What should I do?]

Hugging her knees, she was crouched down, banging her forehead against them, over and over, asking herself the same question again and again.

What should I do? What can I do? How can I break this loop?

Petra: [What is the condition?]

There was a condition to end the loop. ――That is what that person told Petra.

Petra agreed. In a situation like this, where the same thing kept repeating, there always had to be some kind of trigger for the exit condition. It was a given. A promise. A rule, so it had to be followed. No exceptions. It had to be followed. And it was being followed. So there had to be a way to properly end this. Yes, that is it. The discussion is over. Now that it is over, let us think about the condition. What could be the trigger to end it?

"色々やったよ？"
Petra: [I tried all kinds of things, didn’t I?]

By utilizing Compression, she must have faced far more trials and tribulations than an ordinary person ever could.

Of course, Petra had tried running as far away as she could herself, worked together with her comrades even when that failed, then tried to use Compression to evacuate, and she had even deliberately let herself be caught by the man in the Iron Helmet's grasp when he reached out at the very end, and she had even tried throwing herself into his arms. It was all for nothing.

She even considered the possibility that one of her comrades might hold some kind of method to break the deadlock. They all discussed things together, delved deeply into each person's circumstances, shared secrets, listened to each other's family situations, backgrounds, and hometown stories, and shared things they would not even tell a decade-long friend. Nothing worked.

To make sure, she wondered whether approaching the helmeted man was the right move. She talked to him, shunned him, fought him one-on-one without her comrades, winning and losing, fought him without Compression, winning and losing, ran away, mocked him, tried praising him, and even sang to him. It was all for nothing.

Petra: [So, what am I supposed to do now!?]

I did it. Yes, I did. I tried everything I could think of, didn't I? It was all for nothing, it didn't work. It was all pointless.

???: [Let’s get him, you bastards!!]
???: [――YEAHHH!!]

Petra: [Shut up!!]

Even though there was nothing they could do, they shouted so enthusiastically that it made her angry. If they could not help, she wished they would at least not interfere with her thinking. Ah, I'm just venting my frustration. I hate it, I hate it, I hate myself. I don't want to feel this way. What is that, trying to act like a good girl? This is the real me, isn't it? I don't actually like anyone, do I? I just like the version of myself that says, “I love everyone, I adore everyone,” the version that is big-hearted, compassionate, kind, and seemingly impartial. That's it, right?

Petra: [Shut upshut upshut upshut upshut up…!]

Right and left, up and down, front and back, past and future, present, today and tomorrow, yesterday and the day after tomorrow, the day before yesterday, last year and this year, next year, past lives, this life, and the next life―everything, absolutely everything, all of it, every single damn thing, just shut up!

Petra: [――About how many times now?]

Shut up. Die already. Or should I kill you myself?

Al: [Let's continue.]

I knew it

                ×  ×  ×

Al: [――Expand Territory, Matrix Redefinition.]

Back to the same place. Surprising, right? Sometimes he says something other than “Play ball.”

While the loop is active, everyone is not just a puppet, they will react if spoken to, and they will respond if someone does something. Not just everyone, but the man in the Iron Helmet, too.

Of course, no matter what hell she is going through, the man in the iron helmet can tell precisely what is happening.

Petra: [So what if you can?]

Even if he could understand, when the world ends and the next one begins, not even its mastermind will be able to follow.

Petra was always alone, endlessly repeating the same world over and over. No one understood Petra's anguish or struggles. Alone, all alone. All alone. Was she really all alone?

Petra: [――Hk, Subaru! Subaru! Where!? Where are you!?]

"Subaru": [Petra!]

The moment that realization struck her like a bolt of lightning, his figure suddenly appeared before Petra's eyes. Seeing him, she exhaled a long, shaky breath, certain it was indeed Subaru.

Everything seemed to be on the verge of fading away, becoming indiscernible, even so, she had not forgotten everything, nor had she been abandoned.

Petra: [Subaruu…!]

With a tear-stained face, instantly bursting into tears, she ran toward him. She threw herself at him. He instinctively reached out both hands, trying to catch Petra. ――Unable to so.

She fell through. Collapsed onto the bare ground without breaking her fall. It hurt. Her face hit the ground. Subaru ――no, "Subaru" did not embrace Petra. Of course not. It was always like this. "Subaru's" arms were always occupied by someone else.

Petra: [Then don't even bother reaching out in the first place!]

"Subaru": [Petra…]

Petra: [You should have just… just left me! You should have just let me die back then. Back in the village, you should have done nothing, just let the Witchbeats kill me, that would have been just fine… !]

Petra knew. If Natsuki Subaru had not done anything, she would have died long ago.

She should be dead, yet she lived. She ended up living. And because she ended up living, she had to suffer like this, endure this pain, and yet still this would not end.

"Subaru": [Sorry, Petra… I'm sorry! But wait! Please don't talk like that…]

Petra: [H-Huh!? What's that supposed to mean!? I'm suffering through all this pain, and you're scolding me!? I've been hurting like this, over and over, crying this whole time… Y-Yet all you do is scold me? You, scolding me!? Ha, haha, hahaha, stop it!!]

"Subaru": [――――]

She screamed at him. She did it. ――She really did it.

Subaru stood there, his face twisted with tremendous pain and remorse, and Petra felt like she wanted to vomit blood. She wanted to rip out her heart. She wanted to blow her head off. Or rather, she would do just that.

Petra: [The easiest and straightforward trigger to end a loop is to…]

As she spoke, she made a gun with her fingers and pressed her index finger to her temple. Concentrating mana into that fingertip, a faint white light began to glow dimly.

Seeing that, "Subaru" reached out to Petra with a shocked expression. Even though he was unable to touch her, he tried anyway and failed

"Subaru": [Wait, Petra! Don't do it, wait! I understand, I totally get it, but not that way! What if that's exactly what he wants you to do…]

Petra: [Then marry me!!]

"Subaru": [――Hk!]

Petra: [Make me your bride! Be my Subaru! Put me above all else! You saved me, so marry me! Take my entire life into your embrace! Make my life yours! Then I would be fine with it, but that's not how it is, right? Then that's not my life. If it is, then let me decide how to use it.]

She did not even understand what she was saying herself.

Regardless, everything pissed her off. Nothing was going her way. She was furious at everyone who was unable to do anything about her situation, and at the man in the Iron Helmet for putting her in this situation. She hated them. Hated, hated. But she loved Subaru. Ha. It doesn’t make any sense. He isn't doing anything for me, right?. Except he's been doing something all along, and even now, he is still trying to do something about it. Even though he won't marry me.

Petra: [What am I thinking? What an idiot.]

"Subaru": [Petr――]

Ah, I didn't mean that! I wasn't talking about Subaru! I'm the one who's an idiot.

Oh well, I won't be needing a head like this anymore. Bye-bye.

With that thought, a white light shot out from the finger gun with a “bang”――,

                ×  ×  ×

――God, Buddha, Od Lagna. For as long as I live, I vow never to wish for good fortune.

△▼△▼△▼△

――The Witch of Tristitia, Petra Leyte, entered the battle with unwavering resolve.

The Witch Factor entrusted to her by Clind―the possibilities that the Authority of Tristitia could bring were beyond measure. In terms of dictating the course of events to her advantage, it seemed there was no power anywhere in the world that could match its superior effectiveness.

And of course, with such power comes a corresponding price. As the saying goes, ――With great power comes great responsibility. Well, maybe not quite.

In any case, since she had willingly accepted that enormous drawback, the benefits had better be worth every bit and then some. Otherwise, Petra, who had resolved to keep lying even to the ones closest to her, would never find peace.

Petra: [I'm glad Frederica-neesama isn't here.]

If Frederica had joined the Aldebusters, it would have been difficult for Petra to keep up her lies. It was not so much Frederica's shrewdness, but rather Petra's weakness when it came to Frederica.

Petra could not keep secrets from Frederica, someone who commanded her utmost respect and affection. She would surely pour out her heart, cry, cling to Frederica, and beg for comfort.

As for keeping secrets, the same could be said of Ram and Otto at their best. However, Ram was in a celebratory mood over Rem's revival, and Otto, having lost his Memories, was unable to exercise his usual insight. That was why they did not notice Petra's lies.

Petra: [I wonder just how much Clind-niisama knew and chose to overlook.]

Clind, whose age and intentions were unknown, the only thing one could trust was that he was an ally. It would not be strange if he saw right through all of Petra's schemes, and conversely, given how close he was to Roswaal, it would not be surprising if he was utterly oblivious to the subtleties of human hearts.

Regardless, Clind knew from the very beginning that Petra had paid an enormous price.

Since she had already paid such a heavy price, Clind was in a position where either way was conceivable: he could think that she should not have to offer anything else, or he could believe that, since she had paid once, offering more would be the same thing.

Then, from Petra's perspective, the most appropriate way to approach it is to quietly accept that he had wordlessly given her the push she needed.

Regardless of Clind's true intentions, Petra had already rolled the dice.

Petra: [Now, how many was it…]

I will never, imbibe, ever pen a missive, clutch a stuffed toy, put needle to thread, sing, play with children, visit that nostalgic place, hold beautiful flowers, partake of my favorite food, return to my hometown, shed a tear in the company of others, wipe the tears of another, speak of fond reminiscences, retell my favorite stories, call others by terms of endearment, invite another into my home, nurse the deathbed of another, hold the hand of another, desire reconciliation with another, display weakness to another, watch the morning sun in the company of another, be picky about anything, cry for another, wish upon a star with another, rendezvous with another, walk beside another at sunset, tread upon the shadow of one who walks beside me, lament parting with another, discuss my dreams with another, join celebratory events, bestow a gift upon another, wave at anyone, pray before going to sleep, give comfort to wounds, find joy in a clear sky, lament a rainy day, gaze upon a rainbow in the company of another, cherish silence, break an important promise, seek kindness, see someone off, accept anyone's charity, recount my failures, let anyone else braid my hair, wish for good fortune ――There were so many. 

If she recounted all of the sacrifices she had made, there would be no end to it, and it could be said that Petra's life seemed bleak.

Petra: [Even so, this is a lot better than it could be.]

The trick to telling a good lie is to mix in a grain of truth. ―― That's a well-known maxim, after all. In Petra's case, her lie ended up carrying a similar nuance.

――The price of the Authority of Tristitia was to be paid collectively by a large group of people other than its holder, Petra.

That was the condition everyone was willing to accept for letting Petra carry the Witch Factor. However, the only one that could pay the price for this method was the one centered around the Authority's target of Compression.

If Emilia desires it and if Compression was used to move Emilia, it can be activated at Emilia's expense. However, if Petra used Compression to move Emilia because she thought Emilia was in danger, then Petra would bear the cost. ――This was something only the bearer could perceive.

Each and every discussion with the Aldebusters, the moment they flung Al into Agzadd Valley along with Emilia and Rem, the instant they pulled their comrades back from the brink of disaster, and even when they compressed the intense agony felt by everyone into a mere instant, Petra paid the price for all of it.

She had come to understand that the greater the sacrifice, the greater the effect of the Authority of Tristitia.

It seemed to be both an influence on the world and a consequence of Petra's diminished ability to interfere with it in proportion. Most likely, if Petra were to offer her entire life, the Witch Factor of Tristitia would grant her truly immense power.

Petra: [But I won't do that.]

Even if the Authority continued to encroach upon Petra Leyte, chipping away at her future hopes, forcing her to abandon much happiness, as if selling off her life piece by piece, Petra would never throw her life away in despair or resort to that kind of extreme behavior.

Petra: [That would be so uncool.]

She did not want to show her uncool side. She did not want to do uncool things.

It was the same as when she fought Roy Alphard, the Archbishop of Gluttony. ――As long as that feeling kept supporting her, Petra would never lose her true self.

Because Petra, Petra Leyte, reached to the stars――,

△▼△▼△▼△

――God, Buddha, Od Lagna. For as long as I live, I vow never to support anyone from behind.

△▼△▼△▼△

Al: [――Expand Territory, Matrix Redefinition.]

Why did I have to suffer through this?

Did I do something wrong? I was a good girl, right? I was trying my best to be good, wasn't I?

Why? Why did this happen? Someone, please explain to me why.

???: [Let’s get him, you bastards!!]
???: [――YEAHHH!!]

What am I supposed to do? I've tried everything. I've tried over and over.

I did everything I could think of, right? I fought and won, I fought and lost, I fought and let others die, I fought and died myself, I died without putting up a fight, I ran away, I cried.

"星だ。--星が、悪かったのさ"
Al: [――It’s the stars. Your stars were bad.]

I died so many times. I defeated them so many times. I ran away so many times.

I apologized so many times. I got so angry so many times. I cried so many times.

I was so scared. It hurt so much. It was so hard to bear.

Al: [――Play ball.]

I knew it. It was never going to end, was it? It would never end, would it? Even if you hear me crying and screaming right now, even if you worry about me, you'll forget it all, ten seconds later. No, not forget. You won't even know it happened. You'll leave me behind. Just me, abandoned.

Al: [――Expand Territory, Matrix Redefinition.]

I'm done. I hate everyone. I hate you, I hate you, I hate you all so much.

Why won't someone save me? I'm screaming with everything I've got, so why?

It won't end. It never ends. It won't let it end. It won't let me end it. Even now, for myself.

???: [Let’s get him, you bastards!!]
???: [――YEAHHH!!]

No matter how much I cry, scream, fuss, or curse, it's just the same thing repeated over and over.

Wow. I was so deluded. I got all cocky thinking I might actually be able to do something. My reliable, reliable friends? Even though they never do anything? Oh well. My reliable friends… who were they again? That woman and the others were supposed to be so amazing, so why couldn't we get past this?

Al: [――It’s the stars. Your stars were bad.]

But I understand. I get it. Because it can't be helped, right? My thinking just keeps slowing down more and more. I lose interest in the things right in front of me. No, that's not it. It's not that I lose interest, but that I'm trying to distance myself. I understand why I'm doing tha,t too.

Al: [――Play ball.]

Because I don't want to grow to hate everyone. But when I think about everyone, about how they never did anything for me, I end up hating them. So I just won't. I won't think about it anymore. To avoid hating them, I don't want to know about everyone anymore. Ah, wait, that's not right. Sorry, I’m sorry, I lied, a bad lie, I love you all. Yes, l-o-v-e.

Al: [――Expand Territory, Matrix Redefinition.]

Well, there's no helping it. I'm still just a kid. No matter how hard I try to act like an adult, I can't just become one overnight. If I stay here forever, spending the same moments over and over, will I eventually grow up? Nope, sorry, I won't. Because it's just the same time repeating itself. No matter how hard I try, it's always the same. If trying hard changes nothing, then why bother trying at all?

???: [Let’s get him, you bastards!!]
???: [――YEAHHH!!]

Yeah, that's right. Trying my best is meaningless. It's always the same. Haah, I tried so hard, and it was all for nothing. Maybe I should stop thinking so hard about these things. It's all meaningless. I've been doing pointless things this whole time. Right? Yeah, that's right. I figured.

Al: [――It’s the stars. Your stars were bad.]

Besides, what's the point of trying so hard anyway? Even if I give it everything I've got, it won't make me a king. It won't make me important. It won't let me marry that man either. So, it's hopeless. It's just so hopeless.

Al: [――Play ball.]

There's nothing to be done about it. Let's just stop doing anything.

"Subaru": [――There's no such thing as not having a choice.]

What?

"Subaru": [Giving up isn't easy, right? …But, it actually is.]

Why? Why is that?

"Subaru": [A broken heart or even dying is nothing more than a scratch.]

Why? Why is that? How could you still say that?

"Subaru": [Because.]

Why? Why is that? How could you still say that? What’s after that?

"Subaru": [Because――]

Why? Why is that? How could you still say that? What’s after that? What after――?

"Subaru": [――We can do much, much more. It’s a piece of cake.]

△▼△▼△▼△

――Petra Leyte is a country girl from Arlam Village, a village within the Kingdom of Lugunica.

The “original” Petra was not the kind of girl who would participate in a battle that would determine the fate of the world.

As a mere village girl, she could have made a better-than-average life for herself through her charm and cunning, or ended up swallowed by the great tides of the world, her life ending in a pitifully tragic way. That was all she was ever meant to be

But Petra, who had strayed from her "original" route and now knew the person she had become, thought to herself.

Petra: [Even if I could redo my life over and over, I would still stray from my "original" self.]

Yes, that was right. No matter how many times she strayed from her "original" self, Petra would always come back here.

And Petra wanted to say that to the person who saved her by steering her away from her "original" route.

To you, with your pained expression and lousy lies, who tried so hard to pull me away, I wanted to say this.

Petra: [――Thanks to the stars, I'm able to be here.]

"Subaru": [――――]
Al: [――――]

With those words, Petra wiped her lips with the back of her hand, leaving Al and "Subaru" speechless.

Al aside, she could understand why "Subaru" was speechless. He probably thought his clumsy lies and encouragement had depressed Petra so much that she was incomprehensible.

Indeed, they were a poor liar. She had just remarked that the trick to a good lie is to mix in a little truth, yet there was not a single shred of truth mixed in, it was the most clumsy lie imaginable.

Petra: [But I don't want the person I love to be a liar.]

That was why she picked herself up. all on her own. Because neither comfort nor encouragement could be relied on, and he kept looking at her with such worry, trying to pat her head even though he could not touch her, trying to support her back, even if he could not reach, that earnest, desperate look made her think, that was just the weakness of being in love.

Petra: [The person I love isn't a liar!]

Because she was able to stand like this. Since Petra stood, Subaru was not a liar.

This world of repetition was arduous. Rebuilding a spirit that had nearly died once was hardly easy. In fact, it was the most difficult and trying thing Petra had ever faced in her life. But she stood. She stood up. Because right there, there was always someone who believed in the latest, pathetic, and lame version of Petra.

Petra: [There is nothing bad, about my stars.]

Amazing. I have to work hard, so hard. I'm usually pretty talented. I'm the type who can quickly pick up anything, but meeting that person's expectations is not easy at all. But that person believes in me, even in a hell where anyone's spirit would shatter, where they would be forced to repeat the same thing hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of times, they believe without pretext that “Petra won't lose!” So what choice do I have but to do it?

If Natsuki Subaru believed Petra Leyte is a girl tough enough to endure tens of thousands of loops without her spirit breaking, then that is what she would become exactly that.

Al: [Girls from another world can't survive for long unless they can create miracles themselves.]

Exactly, if one does not stray far enough from the "original" fate, one will never even meet someone they can truly love from the bottom of their heart.

Petra: [――Al-san, we could go over this again and again, but I think it’s pointless.]

Petra said, interrupting Al's usual line about the blame of her stars.

It was neither bravado nor bluff, it was Petra's true feelings. ――Even if these moments were repeated not just tens of thousands of times, but hundreds of millions, or even trillions, of times, it could never wear Petra down.

Nor is it some fairy-tale solution like ――a girl's love being infinite.

Petra: [This is the kind of loop that repeats until your enemy’s spirit is completely worn down, right, Al-san?]

Even after defeating Al, even after killing him, even after flinging him far away, it still did not end.

Even if she lost to Al, got captured, or tried to flee far away, it did not end.

 自分を殺しても、殺されても、絶望して全て投げ出そうとしても、終わらなかった。
Even if she killed herself, or was killed, or gave in to despair and tried to abandon everything, it did not end.

Simply put, she had repeated this over ten thousand times, yet it did not end.

Petra: [But then again, you are the one who decides when to call it quits, right, Al-san?]

The only way to end the endless loop was for Al to release the "Domain".

It was not some loop that conveniently ended whenever the target's spirit broke. The end of each loop was surely consciously brought about by Al, who was within it.

Ultimately, if Al were to give up, then this loop could be ended on the first try, let alone ten thousand times. ――That is, if she could make the always cautious, timid Al decide that on the very first attempt.

Petra: [So, please end this here. Everyone except me has already fallen, so Al-san's achievements are more than enough. Continuing now would be pointless.]

To reiterate, this was neither a bluff nor bravado on Petra's part.

Even if this loop kept repeating like this forever, Petra's spirit would never break.

After all, Petra made her choice.

Petra: [I can't give up anymore, I can't regret my choices, I can’t cry because of my regrets, and I can't forget the people I love so dearly. ――That's the kind of Witch I've become.]

――Becuase, Petra Leyte chose to become the «Witch of Tristitia».

Petra: [Hey, Al-san. ――How many more times are we going to have this conversation?]

Yes, at the question posed by the Witch of Tristitia as she tilted her head, Al's throat made a slight sound.

Behind his iron helmet, although Petra could not see, his eyes seemed to hold a dark emotion, as if he had glimpsed something unknowable deep within the round eyes of the Tristitia Witch. Perhaps it was connected to an indelible scar, deeply, deeply rooted within Al's heart.

Perhaps he had been scarred before, having once gazed deeply into the eyes of a Witch.

That trauma――,

Petra: [――Compress Agony]

She Compressed Al's Trauma and inserted it directly into him.

His brain boiled over, blood flowed backward, tore the scab from that unhealed wound, and smeared trauma instead of salt over joy, sorrow, happiness, and misfortune.

The traumatic stimulus that would have made him weep countless times over the rest of his life, tens, hundreds, thousands of times, was now forced upon him in this instant, a thousand times more intense.

Al: [――Ah.]

In that instant, driven by the fear he felt toward the «Witch of Tristitia» and the Compressed trauma that had been forced upon him, Al reached out not with a physical reaction, but with a reaction from his very soul, grasping for the closest, most accessible salvation.

That was――,

Al: [――It’s Game-set!]

――The way to end an endless loop is to start the next one.

Reaching that certainty, the Witch of Tristitia entwined her fingers with the untouchable hand of her beloved beside her, interlacing their fingers as she smiled.

Petra: [How uncool. ――If it were Subaru, he’d put on a brave face and say something like broken spirit, 'tis but just a scratch.]

"Subaru": [Petra, you are too cool.]

Weakly, yet proudly, she heard her beloved tell her so.

The Witch of Tristitia felt her heart swell with those words, but she still faced forward.

 ――Now, this is it, the final showdown.

She had sacrificed everything as payment, her heart that could be wounded, the weakness that made her wish to end it all, the tears that flowed from bitter regret ――and so, until she achieved victory in the form she most desired, the Witch of Tristitia would not relent.

△▼△▼△▼△

――Untie the Domain, re-tie it anew, and reconstruct the matrix.

It was not less than an admission of certain defeat, an acceptance that the Domain, which was supposed to prevail, had been forced upon them and lost.

But it was unavoidable. There was precedent. The Domain cannot kill the Witch who became the aggressor.

Of course, killing is merely a convenient term. In truth, the targeting is confined solely to the spirit――,

???: [――――]

Petra declared she would endure the Domain to the bitter end ――no, she could no longer be called simply Petra. She had transformed and, without irrevocably, became that.

???: [――The Witch of Tristitia.]

In the past, it was the Witch of Greed who overcame the aggressor of Aldebaran's Domain.

Looking back, Aldebaran's Authority had a bad record, in that he suffered defeat in his first battle regardless of whether the initiative in the Domain belonged to the victim or the aggressor.

Be that as it may, even now that the Domain has been successfully dispelled, the battle remained in Aldebaran's favor.

???: [――Hk!]

Apart from the Witch of Tristitia, the so-called Aldebusters who vowed to defeat Aldebaran were annihilated. Unfortunately, the Domain's mental toll was absolute. Aldebaran did not simply decide to impose the «Domain» with half-hearted resolve, thinking it could be evaded through acting or feigning death.

That was precisely why he had to verify by severing one or two limbs of the target before deciding to shift the Domain to the next target. Since he lacked a sense of continuity, he had no way of knowing how he had verified it himself, but if his current self could conceive of it, so could his self within the loop.

That was why he could say it with certainty. ――Only the Witch of Tristitia would stand.

Aldebaran: [But she knows that too.]

Aldebaran would never underestimate the Witch of Tristitia standing before him by acting on the naive assumption that if she could stand, her comrades surely could too.

Then, it existed. Within the Witch of Tristitia, a strategy to turn the tables from here.

――The trump card of the girl who, even after being made a Witch, still boasts that the stars are to be thanked for her present existence.

Aldebaran: [――――]

The «Domain» was released, and for a fleeting moment, Al and the «Witch of Tristitia» were in an unbound state. Though the distance between them was about five meters, yet in the presence of his opponent's Authority, it might as well have been zero ――or rather, with an Authority like Compression in play, distance offered no reassurance whatsoever.

But it is an Authority.

There was no doubt that she would play their trump card, the Authority of Tristitia.

The most likely effect of Authority is, naturally, summoning others through Compression.

The possibilities were――,

Aldebaran: [――Lil’ Miss Rem, Lil’ Miss Meili, or perhaps the Margrave himself?]

When considering forces that could be deployed by the Witch of Tristitia who were not present, those were the names that first came to mind. Rem should be in the midst of a fierce battle with Yae, but since Ram showed no sign of distress, the taste of defeat conveyed through Synesthesia was not conveyed. It was hard to imagine that Yae could be defeated, but it was a situation that had to be considered.

Given Meili's command of numerous Witchbeasts and Roswaal's monstrous firepower that ran rampant throughout the empire, both were entirely plausible.

But all of them are just strong, just formidable, nothing more.

As everything so far has proven, numbers and strength alone cannot overwhelm Aldebaran. If that is indeed the objective, it would be nothing short of foolish――,

Aldebaran: [No――]

None of those, Aldebaran intuitively discerned in the eyes of the Witch of Tristitia.

From the outset, his opponent can Compress her thought process and draw conclusions that ignore the concept of time. An idea Aldebaran might conceive and immediately discard would be discarded by the «Witch of Tristitia» even during the deliberation phase, long before execution. ――In other words, it was something else.

What was needed to change was a fundamental shift in thinking to catch up from the ground up.

If the Tristitia Witch were to bring someone here, it would be someone capable of overturning the whole situation――,

Aldebaran: [――No way!]

He grit his teeth and his eyes widened. In that instant, as if witnessing a spark in Aldebaran's synapses, the Witch of Tristitia raised her hand and brought it down. ――In that split second, Compression occurred.

In that moment, the one who popped in between Aldebaran and the Witch of Tristitia was.

???: [――Woah. This is more of a mess than expected~.]

――It was Roy Alphard of Gluttony, bound by manacles, his movements restrained.

 △▼△▼△▼△

The moment he saw Roy come into view, Aldebaran knew exactly what his opponent's intentions were.

He had estimated the probability that Roy was not dead at about eighty percent.

To begin with, Roy's survival was essential if they were to save the victims of Gluttony. The fact that they had already made him spit out Rem's Name surely strengthened the Aldebusters' conviction.

Regardless of how they would force him to cooperate, they would have had to consider that taking his life would make negotiation impossible. ――The other twenty percent stemmed from two possibilities, the possibility that the situation might be such that keeping him alive was impossible, or that Roy had provoked them so excessively that they became enraged to the point where killing him was unavoidable.

In any case, Roy being alive was sheer luck ――but the enemy's intentions were extremely unfavorable.

The fact that the Witch of Tristitia went out of her way to summon Roy meant that she had a reason, a purpose. If it was not simply aiding the enemy, then there must be an agreement or something that works to her advantage.

And while reading the Book of the Dead, she unexpectedly achieved recovery. Drawing on Natsuki Subaru's knowledge, she could piece together why the Witch of Envy had acted. Understanding that would unlock a chain of possible actions.

That was――,

Aldebaran: [――Reinhard!]

If the Witch of Tristitia had made a secret pact with Roy to have him use his Authority, then, given how utterly corrupted her mind was to the point where even Al's Domain could not break her, it would not be surprising if she made an extreme, self-sacrificing choice to get Natsuki Subaru back.

That was what Aldebaran had also anticipated: the world's salvation by means of the Authority of Gluttony ――to strip away the Memories from those who had read Natsuki Subaru's Book of the Dead.

And as soon as the Witch of Envy withdrew, the restraining force that had been holding the world in check would arrive.

The Sword Saint, who had been successfully repelled once through countless challenges and traps.

――If the Sword Saint Reinhard van Astrea were to arrive, everything would be over.

The plan would collapse. Therefore, Aldebaran poured his entire soul into preventing it.

Through the Authority of Tristitia, Roy Alphard of Gluttony, was brought forth to this place to――,

Aldebaran: [――You’re forbidden to devour any Memories! The curse mark will burn you if you try!]

The once relaxed conditions were tightened yet again.

The repeated alterations to the conditions inflicted severe damage upon the soul of Aldebaran, the one who had applied the curse mark. Deep within his body, he felt a sensation as if his Od was cracking. What he felt there was not pain, but a profound sense of loss―a feeling that damaged his very essence, the same sensation Natsuki Subaru was said to have experienced.

But with this, it prevented the worst-case scenario of Roy consuming the Memories of the Witch of Tristitia.

As long as the «Witch of Envy» did not withdraw, the «Sword Saint» would never arrive at this place――,

Witch of Tristitia: [――Al-san.]

At that moment, he clenched his fist, thinking he had stopped it.

The Witch of Tristitia called out to Aldebaran. Though he must have expected her to look bitter after her plans were thwarted, she certainly looked pained.

But that was not a face lamenting her own future. ――It was one of pity.

Aldebaran: [What――]

With a sensation that made his hair stand on end, Aldebaran pondered the meaning behind the expression of the Witch of Tristitia.

But that was the mistake. I never should have started thinking. Instead of thinking, he should have killed himself immediately. If he had died in that moment, no matter what it was, he could have managed a solution.

At that crucial moment, Aldebaran failed to die once again.

Just as when he let the sun of his world set, once again.

Witch of Tristitia: [――Play ball.]

It was at that moment that the Witch of Tristitia spoke the words Aldebaran had intended to say but failed to utter.

――What stood behind Aldebaran was his natural enemy.

△▼△▼△▼△

Petra: [――I think I figured out Al-san's weakness.]

It was an insight Petra, now the «Witch of Tristitia», had gained during a strategy meeting held to defeat the Al Troupe before the Aldebusters were officially formed.

Based on Old Man Rom's report, Petra realized that Al's Authority was the same looping ability as Natsuki Subaru's Return by Death. If its activation conditions were also the same as Subaru's, then there was a way to prevent it.

However, at that time, she had no definite proof.

It was necessary to confirm with the person themself whether the method she had in mind was feasible, and aside from their connection through the Book of the Dead, Petra had no connection whatsoever with her ――no, with him.

Nevertheless, given the possibility, she contacted him before the Aldebusters operation. She promised he would be brought in as the trump card when Al was truly, truly pushed to his absolute limit.

With that――,

Petra: [――Play ball.]

The Witch of Tristitia returned that pronouncement that was made over and over again, glaring at her opponent behind Roy Alphard, whom she had placed as a decoy between herself and Al.

Tragically, Al moved exactly as the Witch of Tristitia had envisioned, precisely as she had wished.

She had predicted that as soon as Al saw Roy, he would believe the goal was to make him use his Authority. ――Roy, who had made a secret pact with Felt and harbored treasonous thoughts toward Al. She had thought that if there had been any time during his "Turning Back Time" that Al had an opportunity to extract that knowledge, he would grow suspicious of Roy's intentions.

Indeed, just as she had anticipated, Al acted accordingly and chose to seal away the potential of Roy's betrayal.

In fact, the Witch of Tristitia's trump card materialized behind him at the exact same moment as Roy did, something entirely outside of the realm of his imagination. He never could have envisioned that person being there.

There was no lie in the statement that the sixty-one members of the Aldebusters present here constituted the total combat strength that the Emilia and Felt camps could muster. ――Those were the participants from the Emilia and Felt camps.

Consequently――,

???: [You're looking a bit claw-bered, aren't you? ――Let me fix you up, Kay?]

In that instant, the greatest healing magic was cast, Ferris the "Blue", the greatest healer to be found anywhere in the world, stripped death away from Al.

△▼△▼△▼△

――The Blue, Felix Argyle. Commonly referred to as Ferris.

The First Knight of the Royal Selection candidate Crusch Karsten, and the kingdom's greatest ――no, the world's greatest practitioner of healing magic. And the last of Aldebaran's three natural enemies.

The final obstacle for Aldebaran, who had successfully managed to foil both Natsuki Subaru and the Sword Saint Reinhard van Astrea for the sake of his plan, was one he absolutely must avoid encountering.

And that person cast a gentle, merciful, yet cruel magic upon Aldebaran.

Aldebaran: [Ah, Gaaaaaah――!!]

In that instant when every hair on his body stood on end, Aldebaran swung his body with all his might, flinging the opponent standing behind him ――Ferris to the ground, and released the poison packet in his mouth.

It dissolved instantly on his tongue's mucous membrane, posing a grave threat to Aldebaran's vital functions and killing him within seconds ――but it did not. The tissues that should have been destroyed were repaired one by one, and even the blood gushing from his nose inside the helmet stopped within a second.

Aldebaran: [Fuck――]

Then, in a flash, he conjured a stone dao, pressed it against his own throat, and then drew it with all his might.

Major arteries were severed, and blood gushed out violently ――yet it did not threaten Aldebaran's life. The wounds were instantly repaired, and the pain felt no worse than a pinprick.

Aldebaran: [Fuck, Fuck, FUCK…!]

He had been had. This was the most terrifying and effective method yet to neutralize Aldebaran.

The method to neutralize Return by Death was simple. ――Do not let them die. That was all that was necessary.

The gentlest means in the world is how to suppress Aldebaran and Natsuki Subaru.

Petra: [With that, this is the end, Al-san.]

Yes, the «Witch of Tristitia» quietly told the pathetically mortified Aldebaran.

Unable to die. Unable to start over. So he considered forcing Ferris, who was lying beside him, to release the healing magic――,

Ferris: [Not a chance. Or do you want to have a pointless endurance contest with Ferri-chan?]

Ferris did not even flinch when a sword was pointed at him. He, too, was one who had steeled his resolve and stepped forward to challenge.

If Ferris had already performed healing magic on himself equivalent to the one that Aldebaran was currently receiving, then no matter how hard he struggled, he would never be able to get Ferris to remove the spell in this situation.

In other words, Aldebaran had to make a move here――,

???: [――There is nobody who can defeat you, you whom I created.]

Aldebaran: [――――]

Once again, the Witch's voice echoed. ――It was at that very moment.

A tremendous, devastating shockwave erupted in the distance, and in a single instant, it engulfed Aldebaran, the Witch of Tristitia, and all who were present upon this final stage.

△▼△▼△▼△

――It was by no means an assist deliberately triggered by the Divine Dragon.

When the battlefield had shifted, and the battle with the true owner of the dragonhusk raged on, and the Dragon's dragonhalo was pierced by the miraculous super-magic achieved by the two magicians, the Divine Dragon made a momentous choice.

Rather than the immediate victory that laid before its eyes at that moment, the Dragon prioritized fulfilling its other half's purpose―the goal, the wish, that long-cherished desire that they had set out to achieve.

Volcanica: [――――HAAHRAAN!!]

The final breath unleashed by the Dragon was not directed at the dragonkin or the magicians, but toward a distant land ――striking its intended target: the great hole in the earth, the Grand Mogolade Geyser, said to be the deepest, darkest abyss in the world, extending all the way to the very foundation of the world.

The cataclysmic destruction and world-shaking marvel caused by it were beyond description, yet even upon this battlefield, it surged forth as a great wave of earth.

In that very moment of the decisive battle between Aldebaran and the Witch of Tristitia, a great wave broke upon the battlefield.

Aldebaran: [――――]

Unaware of what had happened, Aldebaran was engulfed by the tremendous force of the erupting water and the billowing cloud of dust that surged forth. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ――He was truly amazed by the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that had arrived.

This was, without a doubt, an unexpected opportunity that was offered to Aldebaran, and certainly his last.

It was not the work of the «Witch of Tristitia», but rather a stroke of luck that should have been a once-in-a-lifetime rarity for Aldebaran ――the very kind that he had believed he had used up entirely upon meeting Priscilla.

Aldebaran: [――Hk.]

The momentary daze lasted only an instant. Aldebaran, battered by wind and water, strained his eyes across the battlefield shrouded in spray and searched.

Not for the Witch of Tristitia, nor Ferris, nor the fallen Aldebusters.

This was the one and only, last possible move Aldebaran could make on this battlefield.

With Death closed off and his comrades gone, Aldebaran sought the final means to fulfill the long-cherished desire he pursued alongside the Witch who remained only within himself.

And that was――,

Aldebaran: [――Roy!! If you're still there, come here! Devour… devour my "Name"!!]

Aldebaran shouted, desperately altering the conditions of the curse mark, feeling the immense strain caused his Od to crack once more, prepared to make his soul bleed.

The only strategy available to Aldebaran, whose Authority has been sealed, was to reset this situation to zero.

By having his "Name" devoured and erased from everyone’s memory, he could overturn everything.

To that end, Aldebaran searched the thick, swirling dust for the figure of the loathsome Gluttony and shouted.

Aldebaran: [Come devour me! My, my "Name" is――]

Given the name Aldebaran, an entity burdened to carry the fate of a "Following Star".

A good-for-nothing who bore the fate of removing Natsuki Subaru from the world to fulfill the Witch's long-cherished desire, yet still yearned for the sun despite that fate, and ultimately lost everything.

That "Name" was――,

Aldebaran: [Rigel. ――It’s Natsuki Rigel!]

That was the name of the foolish star that betrayed the expectations of the Witch and let the sun set.
